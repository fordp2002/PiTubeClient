ADDP: should clear the F flag, but doesn't

SUBP: should clear the F flag, but doesn't

We have some general issues with instructions that have an operand
that is "addr" OR "regaddr" access class.
1. Correct handling of both register and memory operands
2. Correct handling of TOS (SP should not be modified)
Specifics below:

Access class addr:
- ADDR  - bug when register used, should call ReadAddress()
- CHECK - bug when register used, should call ReadAddress()
- CMPM  - bug when register used, should call ReadAddress()
- CVTP  - bug when register used, should call ReadAddress()
- CXPD  - bug when anything other than register uses, also TOS bug
- JSR   - correctly uses ReadAddress()
- JUMP  - correctly uses ReadAddress()
- MOVM  - bug when register used, should call ReadAddress()
- MOVSU - not implemented
- MOVUS - not implemented
- RDVAL - not implemented
- WRVAL - not implemented

Access class regaddr:
- CBIT  - looks bug free (TOS OK, because reads and writes TOS)
- CBITI - looks bug free (TOS OK, because reads and writes TOS)
- IBIT  - looks bug free (TOS OK, because reads and writes TOS)
- SBIT  - looks bug free (TOS OK, because reads and writes TOS)
- SBITI - looks bug free (TOS OK, because reads and writes TOS)
- TBIT  - has TOS bug because because ReadGen() used read only
- EXT   - looks very buggy, offset added to dest not base!!!
- EXTS  - has TOS bug for base because ReadGen() used read only
- INS   - looks very buggy, offset addes after base read!!! (also TOS bug)
- INSS  - looks bug free (TOS OK, because reads and writes TOS)

BitPrefix() doesn't correctly handle negative offset

INS has the "% 8" bug when reading the offset operand.

Review use of signed values for offsets in INS/INSS/EXS/EXTS.

CMPM: N and L flag not set correctly for W and D sizes

LPR: procreg=USP (1011) doesn't correctly update user stack pointer

SPR: procreg=USP (1011) and INTBASE (1110) not implemented

MEIi: Probably a bug when TOS used for destination

NEGi: Probably a bug in setting the F flag when src is the most -ve number

Investigate what direct-exception mode is, as it affects behaviour of RETT

SETCFG: implemented but nscfg had no effect

Add WARNings on undefined behaviour:
- ASHi count operand out of range
- LSHi count operand out of range
- CHECKi when bounds is a register

Missing Floating point instructions:
- ABSf
- ADDf
- CMPf
- DIVf
- DOTf

- MOVf
- MOVif
- MOVFL
- MOVLF
- MULf
- NEGf
- POLYf
- ROUNDfi
- SCALBf
- SFSR
- SUBf
- TRUNCfi

Missing Memory Management instructions:
- LMR
- MOVSU
- MOVUS
- RDVAL
- SMR
- WRVAL

Missing Integer instructions:
- CINV
- DIA
- FLAG
- INDEX
- RETI
- WAIT

Missing Traps:
- Integer Overflow Trap (OVF) and V flag
- Illegal Operation Trap (IIL) on privileged operations in user mode
